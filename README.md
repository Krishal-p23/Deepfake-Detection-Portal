Deepfake Detection Portal

In this project, we have employed the meso-4 module from the mesoNet research paper that was published in September, 2018.
Kindly check the DDS directory to know what and how our portal works.


Future enhancements:
1. Extension of the portal from image/video deepfake detection to audio detections.
2. Replacement of meso-4 module with a light weight model for image deepfake detection.
